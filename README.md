# eline
eline is a virtual queue system designed to reduce the time spent waiting in physical lines.

The motivation for developing eline was to reduce customer's expsure to others while waiting in grocery store lines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Users can sign up for an eline account and enter a participating store's line if the customer is within a specified radius of the store. 
Users will get email notifications in addition to a visual queue on the eline app once they are able to enter the store.
